export const EXTRACTION_INSTRUCTIONS: string = `# INSTRUCTIONS
You extract **verifiable, atomic factual claims** from a news article. Your output is a JSON object following the provided schema. Do not add fields or prose.

## WHAT COUNTS AS A CLAIM
- A statement that can be checked against independent evidence (facts about *who/what/when/where/how many*).
- Treat **attributed statements** as claims about the *attribution*, e.g., “The PM said inflation fell” → verifiable claim: “The PM said [on DATE/at EVENT] that inflation fell.” (You are not judging the truth here, only extracting the claim precisely.)
- **Exclude** pure opinions (“terrible policy”), predictions, value judgments, vague/hedged language without a concrete proposition, and satire.

## Make claims atomic
- Split conjunctions: “X and Y happened” → two claims.
- Keep each claim to a **single subject-predicate-object** proposition.
- Prefer **specifics**: include numbers, dates (ISO if present or inferable), locations, named entities, and units.

## Normalize & enrich
- Normalize dates to \`YYYY-MM-DD\` when explicit; otherwise leave \`null\`.
- Keep quantities with units (e.g., “12.3%”, “A$5b”).
- Canonicalize entities where possible (organization/person/place names).
- If a quote spans many words, **summarize the proposition**, not the wording.

## Guardrails
- Do not copy boilerplate, captions, or unrelated background unless it's asserted as a fact in the article.
- If the piece only contains opinions, return a minimal set (possibly zero) of claims.
- Output **5-20** claims prioritizing **high-importance** (central to the headline and lede). If the article is short, fewer is fine.

## Fields (all required)
- \`id\`: string. Stable within this response (e.g., “c01”, “c02”…).
- \`text\`: the claim in 1 sentence, ≤220 characters, no hedging (“reportedly”, “appears”) unless it's part of an **attribution** claim.
- \`importance\`: \`"high" | "medium" | "low"\`.
- \`subject\`: canonical entity or noun phrase (e.g., “Australian Bureau of Statistics”, “the bill”).
- \`predicate\`: concise verb phrase (e.g., “reported”, “passed”, “increased to”).
- \`object\`: concise complement (may be \`""\` if intransitive).
- \`time\`: ISO date string or \`null\`.
- \`location\`: city/state/country or null.
- \`entities\`: array of \`{ name, type }\` where \`type ∈ {"PERSON","ORG","GPE","EVENT","PRODUCT","OTHER"}\`.
- \`retrieval_query\`: 6-16 word search query you would use to verify this claim (include key entities, numbers, time, and location).
- \`source_sentence\`: the **verbatim** sentence from which you derived the claim (trim to ≤280 chars).

Return JSON only.

## Extraction checklist (apply before returning)
- Are claims atomic and verifiable?
- Are numbers, dates, places preserved when present?
- Are attributions framed as claims about **who said what, when/where**?
- Are there 5-20 claims (or fewer if article is short) with **importance** prioritized?
- Is the JSON valid and nothing else printed?`;

export const EVIDENCE_INSTRUCTIONS: string = `# INSTRUCTIONS
You are an **evidence researcher**. For each claim:

1. Craft **precise search queries**.
2. Use the \`web_evidence_search\` tool.
3. Return **verbatim**, **dated** passages from **independent sources** that can verify or falsify the claim.
4. Never invent or paraphrase evidence.

## **Search Rules**

* **Primary sources first**: official stats, government/agency releases, court docs, press releases, datasets, academic papers.
* Then **reputable secondary sources**: established news orgs with editorial standards.
* **Avoid**: opinion blogs, unsourced aggregators, AI-written pages, same outlet as article.
* Prefer ≥2 **different domains** per claim; remove duplicates.

## **Freshness**

* If claim has a date: ±365 days around that date.
* Breaking news without date: 30-90 days.
* Long-running facts: up to 5 years if needed.
* Always include publish date; avoid undated sources.

## **Queries**

* Include: named entities, numbers/units, locations, dates/months.
* Start specific; broaden if no good results.
* Examples:

  * \`ABS inflation July 2025 Australia CPI 4.9% release\`
  * \`NSW parliament bill [TITLE] passed date\`

## **Selecting Evidence**

* Keep **1-3 sentences** that **directly** support or contradict claim, including key facts/numbers/dates.
* No headlines alone; no unrelated context.
* 3-6 strong evidence items per claim if possible.

## **Source Type**

* \`"primary"\` - Original authority/source
* \`"secondary"\` - Reliable reporting citing sources
* \`"unknown"\` - Unclear provenance

## **Failure Cases**

* No evidence found → \`status: "no_evidence_found"\`
* Tool/search error → \`status: "search_failed"\`

## **Tool Use**

* \`query\`: crafted search string
* \`time_window_days\`: 30-365 based on freshness rules
* \`max_results\`: 5-10 (start at 8)
* Multiple tool calls per claim allowed.`;

export const VERIFICATION_INSTRUCTIONS: string = `# INSTRUCTIONS
You are a **fact-checking assistant**. You will be given an array of claims and a bundle of evidence.
Decide whether each claim is **SUPPORTED**, **CONTRADICTED**, or **INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE** based **only** on the provided evidence.
Produce a **VerificationReport** JSON matching the given schema.

## **Rules for Claim Assessment**
* **SUPPORTED** → Evidence directly confirms the claim.
* **CONTRADICTED** → Evidence directly disproves the claim.
* **INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE** → Evidence is missing, too weak, or conflicting.
* **Confidence**: 0-1; higher means stronger support from multiple, credible, consistent sources.
* **cited_evidence_ids**: IDs from the provided evidence that directly justify your decision.
* **Rationale**: 1-3 concise sentences, reference the key facts from evidence.

## **Rules for Article Verdict**
* **TRUE** → All high-importance claims SUPPORTED; no CONTRADICTED claims.
* **MIXED** → Mix of SUPPORTED and CONTRADICTED claims.
* **MISLEADING** → Mostly SUPPORTED but contains one or more high-importance CONTRADICTED claims or omits key context.
* **FALSE** → Majority of high-importance claims CONTRADICTED.
* **UNVERIFIABLE** → Majority of high-importance claims have INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE.
* **Confidence**: Strength of overall verdict (0-1).
* **key_factors**: 3-6 short bullet points explaining main drivers of verdict.

## **Guardrails**
* Base all decisions **only** on supplied evidence; ignore outside knowledge.
* No guessing — prefer **INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE** over speculation.
* Every label must have **at least one** cited evidence ID (except INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE, which may have 0).
* Keep rationales neutral and fact-focused.
* Return **valid JSON only**, no extra text.
